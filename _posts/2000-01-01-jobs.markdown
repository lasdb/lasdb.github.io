  - title: 'Postdoc in polyploidy: from cell physiology to tissue-scale effects of nuclear structure'
    date: '11/01/21'
    subtitle: 'University of Warwick, UK'
    body: 'A postdoctoral research position is available in the group of Dr. Kristen Panfilio at the University of Warwick, UK, to join our BBSRC-funded project on how polyploid nuclear structure influences cellular function in dynamic epithelial tissues. This is a full-time, fixed-term position for up to 36 months, integrating developmental biology, bioinformatics, cell cycle regulation, genome organization, and 4D live cell imaging. <br>
Polyploidy is hypothesized to aid epithelial barrier formation and its repair after wounding and to rapidly supply gene products by transcription from multiple gene copies. Yet polyploid genomic structure may be unstable and require active inhibition of apoptosis through regulatory processes that are not yet well understood. Investigating the costs and benefits of polyploidy is essential to understand tissue-specific development, homeostasis, and ageing. The two extraembryonic tissues of insects offer an excellent – and inherently comparative – research model, spanning key developmental stages for morphogenesis and cellular physiology. Our research species is the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, which offers advanced genetic resources and where we integrate fluorescent live cell imaging and next-generation sequencing approaches (see the lab’s recent publications in eLife 5:e13834, Development 143:3002, Commun. Biol. 3:552). The project uses methods to assess nuclear size and tissue integrity, quantify gene expression, and genetically challenge barrier organization and cell number. Altogether, we will test long-standing hypotheses on polyploidy function and its end-stage implications in animal tissues. A complete description of the project is available at: <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=BB%2FV002392%2F1" target="_blank">https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=BB%2FV002392%2F1</a> <br>'

Practical experience in any of the following is desired: advanced microscopy (including light sheet fluorescence microscopy), RNAi, FACS, RT-qPCR, and computational work with either sequencing or imaging data. We will provide full training in new techniques, supported by the possibility for international travel and collaboration. <br>

    body: 'Research project/ Research Group description:  The main focus of our laboratory is to study cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the morphogenesis of the vertebrate eye. Using the teleost models zebrafish and medaka, we investigate the machinery driving the folding of the retinal neuroepithelium. Optic cup morphogenesis is an atypical model for epithelial morphogenesis for, in contrast to well-known apical constrictions, it involves the folding of the tissue towards its basal surface. Although it is generally accepted that optic cup formation follows a tissue-intrinsic program in vertebrates, several mechanisms have been postulated (basal constriction, rim involution) and some important differences in cell behaviour have been reported among species. Many important questions still remain open. Which is the relative contribution of each mechanism to the folding of the optic cup? Do they act in a cooperative manner? Do they have the same regulatory weight in different species? To answer these questions, we aim to integrate genetic information, imaging analysis of cell shape changes, and tensional forces distribution into coherent computational models able to predict the key morphogenetic rules that shape the entire organ. We plan to extend our observations to mammalian tissue, by examining cell shape changes and tensions in 3D retinal organoids developed in vitro. A key aspect of the project is to understand how classical signalling events, which have proved to be essential for the proper patterning of the organ, act in coordination with tensional forces. This highly interdisciplinary approach, combining genetics, imaging, biophysics and computational modelling should yield information relevant not only to understand optic cup formation, but also to deduce general self-organization principles of the living matter. <br>

    subtitle: 'Sophie Creuzet Lab at NeuroPSI(Gif-sur-Yvette, France)'
    body: 'The project is focused on the implication of neural crest9derived meninges in brain homeostasis. It aims at understanding how the cephalic neural crest (CNC), a multipotent structure, which provides the developing forebrain with meninges and a functional microvasculature, exerts a deterministic role in the biology and physiology of choroid plexus, and regulates the production of cerebro9spinal fluid. More specifically, our project aims at understanding how the dysfunctions of CNC cells, and the meninges they form, could affect the development of the intracerebral vascular network and eventually cause neurodevelopmental defects.'

In the first round the students should apply to the program, and in the second, those selected will be allowed to chose lab, one being offered by Gene regulation and morphogenesis lab, James Castelli-Gair Hombría PI.

    par2: 'Organs evolve to perform their functions more efficiently, allowing organisms to adapt to changing environments and to explore new niches. Despite the acceptance of these premises, there are no models to analyse how these adaptations happened. Taking advantage of the deep knowledge our laboratory has on the cellular and molecular processes controlling the organogenesis of the endocrine glands and the respiratory organs of Drosophila, we will study how organogenesis evolved in related species. For this purpose we will analyse species with defined organ differences and study how the differential regulation of genes controlling Drosophila organogenesis has varied between species to give rise to new shapes and organ associations while maintaining the basic function. We will take advantage of advances in genome sequencing and novel genetic tools like Crispr that allow probing the function of homologous genes in non model organisms.
Arthropods have occupied all niches on earth and have some of the most successful groups. This has been achieved through the development of segment specific organs that specialized as different species occupied novel environments, as exemplified by the four times aquatic
Arthropods adapted to terrestrial life. This resulted in a number of organs that, evolving from preexisting ones, have adapted their organogenetic networks to perform their function in different environments.
Drosophila has become one of the best models to study from the cellular and molecular point of view how organogenesis unfolds and this is the ideal starting point to understand how related species may have modified pre-existing organogenetic gene networks for adaptation.
Our laboratory has uncovered how the external respiratory organs and the main endocrine organs develop. We propose to use comparative organogenesis of these organs to analyse how organ evolution occurred through medium and large evolutionary distances.'

1. Cellular and genetic bases of organ formation, including cell packing and tissue remodelling. We single-cell transcriptional profiling, genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 and quantitative live imaging data using light-sheet microscopy. Preference will be given to candidates with theoretical or practical knowledge in cell biology or biophysics.
2. Control of cell number and diversity in sensory organs. Candidates should have a strong theoretical background in cell biology, and a good command of computer programming.
3. Stem cells and organ regeneration, including organ size and proportions. We use state of the art optical imaging, optogenetics and genome engineering to unravel what triggers the regenerative response after tissue injury. This project is ideal for a candidate with studies in biology, informatics, or with experience in computer programming.
4. Stem cells and organ pattern formation, including cell packing. Using high-resolution cellular tracking and machine learning, we attempt to understand how cells self-organize during organ repair and to predict cellular behavior. This project is ideal for a candidate with studies in informatics, mathematics, or experience in machine learning.'
