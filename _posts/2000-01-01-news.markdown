    In 2025 we will be continuing our efforts to diversify our Workshop programme so that we are able to support a wider selection of research communities around the world. We will be reserving one of our Workshops for an application from a Global South (GS) country to host an event overseas. Our aim is to provide easier access for The Company of Biologists Workshops, bringing together world class scientists from home and abroad, and giving opportunities to local early-career researchers to attend. <br>
For your application to qualify for this funding, you will need to be applying to host the Workshop in one of the GS countries listed here: <br>
<a href="http://www.fc-ssc.org/en/partnership_program/south_south_countries" target="_blank">http://www.fc-ssc.org/en/partnership_program/south_south_countries</a><br>

* At least one organiser who is based in host region to act as a local contact throughout <br>
* Recommendations for a local venue to host the Workshop <br>
* Recommendations for accommodation and food for all attendees <br>
* An explanation of how this Workshop will benefit scientific research in your region <br>
* The focus should be on cutting-edge scientific research in topic areas that are novel and not covered by traditional conferences <br>
* Proposals that concentrate on emerging or cross-disciplinary themes are particularly encouraged <br>
We typically expect organisers to be experts in their field, or have sufficient standing to attract world-class speakers and attendees. We envisage each Workshop consisting of 35 delegates including 15 speakers and 20 early-career researchers (places to be applied for). Proposers should ensure maximum diversity in the proposed attendee list <br>
As the scientific organiser, your involvement will be focused on the science. We will undertake most of the logistical arrangements, liaise with the venue, organise speaker travel and assist with the programme construction. We hope to work closely with our local contact to help put on the best possible Workshop for all of our attendees, so we would welcome any local knowledge and support to make the event a success. We may also require some assistance in finding local suppliers and technical support for the event in some cases. <br>
The Workshop will be entirely funded by The Company of Biologists, including all accommodation, venue and travel costs throughout the event. We will also provide travel bursaries for qualifying early-career researchers to help them get to the Workshop. <br>

    subtitle: 'Report from the organizers'
    body: 'The 5th Argentine Workshop on Developmental and Cellular Biology was held in November, 2022 in Chascomús, Province of Buenos Aires. The Meeting was exciting and successful. The presentations by speakers (both investigators and students) as well as the poster presentations were exceptional. 
This was the fifth meeting we organized since 2013. Our goal has been to generate an environment that promotes active discussions of the latest advances in Developmental and Cell Biology in our local scientific community. The sustained attendance and enthusiastic participation confirms that it continues covering a vacancy of interest for a considerable number of research groups in Argentina.
A total of more than 60 graduate students and postdocs and 30 junior/senior investigators were part of the Meeting. Thirty-five talks were delivered by students and investigators from institutes throughout the country. To encourage participation, the registration costs were kept very low and fellowships to partially covered the expenses were granted to all attendants. 
To promote scientific discussion and participation of the youngsters, the symposium was organized in such a way that students and more established investigators, all delivered talks of the same duration in joined sessions without differences. This format was extremely successful, as the it developed in a highly productive and informal atmosphere with intense discussions that usually continued at the coffee breaks after the talks. 
Two poster sessions complemented the program, so that every student had the chance to present and discuss his/her research work (~50 posters). Different model organisms were represented in the program, including mouse, chick, frog, zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans and plants. 
In summary, the meeting was a big success because of the excellent quality of the science, the great atmosphere and the fruitful interaction between students and investigators. <br>

Each Workshop will consist of 35 delegates including 15 speakers and 20 early-career researchers (places to be applied for). Proposers should ensure maximum diversity in the proposed attendee list. <br>
As the scientific organiser, your involvement will be focused on the science. We will undertake most of the logistical arrangements, liaise with the venue, organise speaker travel and assist with the programme construction. We hope to work closely with our local contact to help put on the best possible Workshop for all of our attendees, so we would welcome any local knowledge and support to make the event a success. We may also require some assistance in finding local suppliers and technical support for the event in some cases. <br>
The Workshop will be entirely funded by The Company of Biologists, including all accommodation, venue and travel costs throughout the event. We will also provide travel bursaries for qualifying early-career researchers to help them get to the Workshop.<br>

    subtitle: 'Cells & Development: the future of MoD'
    body: 'The journal “MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT” (MoD) was born almost half a century ago under the name of “CELL DIFFERENTIATION”. Moving forward, this journal will open its pages to the study of the CELL and its role in DEVELOPMENT, and to reflect this change it will be renamed “CELLS & DEVELOPMENT”.  Furthermore, QUANTITATIVE BIOLOGY papers will be an important addition to our journal.  To reflect these changes, we have added the following subtitle: CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AND THEIR QUANTITATIVE APPROCHES.<br>
In addition to the above changes in topic and title, the new journal will create new sections and new activities that will directly benefit the cell, developmental and quantitative biology community. To achieve all these changes a new Editor-in-Chief has been appointed: Roberto Mayor, University College London, UK; and we have named a new panel of Associate Editors: Carl-Philipp Heisenberg (Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Austria), Sally Horne-Badovinac (University of Chicago, Chicago, United States), Ana-Maria Lennon-Duménil (Institut Curie, Paris, France), Guillaume Salbreux (Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom) and Didier Stainier (Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim, Germany).  This group of outstanding cell and developmental biologists will help us to guide the new “CELLS & DEVELOPMENT” journal toward the future. <br>
CELLS & DEVELOPMENT will consider papers in any area of cell biology or developmental biology, in any model system like animals and plants, using a variety of approaches, such as cellular, biomechanical, molecular, quantitative, computational and theoretical biology.
Areas of particular interest include: 
•	Cell and tissue morphogenesis
•	Cell adhesion and migration
•	Cell shape and polarity
•	Biomechanics
•	Theoretical modelling of cell and developmental biology
•	Quantitative biology
•	Stem cell biology
•	Cell differentiation
•	Cell proliferation and cell death
•	Evo-Devo
•	Membrane traffic
•	Metabolic regulation
•	Organ and organoid development
•	Regeneration <br>
CELLS & DEVELOPMENT  is the official journal of The International Society of Developmental Biologists which supports the world-wide community of developmental biologists and we will create new tools to equally support the cell biology community. <br>
It is our hope that this new phase of this half-centennial journal will be become a forum for interdisciplinary research that combines biology, physics and mathematics to understand how a cell works and how a single cell, the egg, develops into an embryo.'

    body: 'We are very sad to learn that Jose Luis Gomez-Skarmeta passed away today. A terrific scientist and friend who will be missed and remembered. Our sincere condolences to his family and friends.<br>
We share here a letter by his colleagues in the Developmental Biology lab in Chile.<br><br>
Ha partido nuestro amigo y colega luego de una batalla corta contra un cáncer. José Luis era investigador del Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo en Sevilla, España. Su investigación más reciente se relacionaba con los mecanismos genómicos que regulan el desarrollo y que impactan en la evolución de los vertebrados.<br>
José Luis tenía raíces chilenas (sobrino del escritor Antonio Skarmeta) pero creció y estudió en España. Su doctorado lo realizó en el Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa de Madrid, en el laboratorio del genetista Juan Modolell. Allí hizo estudios pioneros en Drosófila, desentrañando los mecanismos que inician los procesos de neurogénesis del sistema sensorial. Descubrió los genes de la familia Iroquois y nombró a dos de ellos como araucan y caupolican, en honor a los guerreros de Arauco. Al terminar su doctorado, resolvió trasladarse a Chile, a nuestro Departamento de Biología, donde estuvo desde 1997 al 2000. Allí, junto a Roberto Mayor y Miguel Allende, refundaron el laboratorio de Biología del Desarrollo que quedó vacante con la partida de Luis Izquierdo. Durante su estadía en Chile, trabajó con el anfibio Xenopus laevis, estudiando los genes involucrados en neurogénesis en ese modelo. En ese periodo, se formaron en el grupo Verónica Palma y Alvaro Glavic, quienes hoy suceden a José Luis y a Roberto Mayor como integrantes del grupo. José Luis retornó a España, primero brevemente en Madrid para luego obtener su plaza en Sevilla. Formó numerosos estudiantes y postdocs, entre ellos varios chilenos, y publicó trabajos de altísimo impacto, trabajando en pez cebra y en otros modelos.<br>
Recordamos a José Luis como un carismático y brillante científico. Por sobre todo, era un excelente amigo y colaborador desinteresado, era una persona de gran transparencia, tanto en lo científico como en lo humano. Hizo muchas amistades en su paso por la Facultad, tanto entre académicos como con los funcionarios, todos quienes lo recuerdan con cariño. Se mantuvo siempre vinculado con nosotros y pudimos disfrutar de su compañía por última vez en enero del 2019, cuando organizó un simposio con nosotros sobre genómica. Tuvimos mucha suerte de poder tenerlo cerca y contarlo entre nuestros buenos amigos.<br>

We had more than 120 participants from many Latin American that presented their work in oral or poster presentations. In addition, 15 outstanding researchers in the field from Canada, USA, Israel, Spain, France, Austria and Scotland gave plenary and short talks. This Meeting consolidated the growing Latin American Worm Community and defined time and place for the next one: March 2022,Valparaiso-Chile. The meeting was divided into short talk sessions that included among other topics: neural mechanisms of aging, stress and neurodegeneration, germline development, autophagy, apoptosis, and worm metabolism. There were a total of 42 talks and 57 posters. More than 6 hours were devoted for posters sessions during the 3 days. II LAWM had Dr. Victor Ambros as a keynote speaker talking about the mechanisms of microRNAs control during C.elegans development. The Meeting was scientifically enriching and an excellent up-to-date overview on C.elegans research. The network of Latin American worm labs has expanded and collaborations within the Latin American and with the international community strengthened and new ones were established.'

    body: 'The LASDB General Assembry appointed Juan Riesgo-Escovar (Instituto de Neurobiología, UNAM, Querétaro, Mexico) as the new President of the Society!<br><br>
    Dear members of the LASDB. <br>
We just had a great meeting in Buenos Aires to cap the end of October, and it really was the confirmation of Spring. A great deal of cutting-edge and exciting science was discussed, showing how vibrant and alive the LASDB is, and we look forward with anticipation to the next meeting, in two years time. This time there was a record of participation, and most to those attending were students, who discussed their work at length in the poster sessions. Already, many people how attended as students in the first LASDB meetings are now researchers, demonstrating the positive effect that the LASDB meetings and associated courses have had over its sixteen years of existence. We hope to continue on all those trends in the future, bringing ever more first rate science and students and PIs together, expanding developmental biology in the region, in an ever growing virtuous circle. Kudos to this last meeting organizers, and to the bright future of developmental biology in the region. As president of the LASDB, I really hope to continue all these positive trends, and greatly appreciate the confidence deposited in me.<br>

    body: 'This EMBO Workshop is intended to cover the most recent work on the different aspects of the biology of a group of axial progenitors, often referred to as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), that play a fundamental role in the development of vertebrate embryos. We will stimulate discussions on the normal development and regeneration potential of these cells by bringing together a diverse group of researchers studying the activity of NMPs in a variety of animal models with those developing robust protocols to induce NMPs from pluripotent cells of mouse and human origin, as well as methods to further direct them towards specific cell lineages. An additional important goal for this workshop is to include researchers working on biological processes or cell-types exhibiting features that might suggest involvement of NMP-like activities, despite the fact that this cell-type is not the primary focus of their research. We expect this EMBO Workshop to act as a catalyst for interactions among researchers working in a variety of experimental paradigms in order to expand our knowledge of NMPs and their potential for regenerative medicine approaches in humans.'

    body: 'C. elegans researchers from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico that have confirmed attendance to this Symposium have enthusiastically received this initiative. The impact of this project it is not limited to a small group of scientists in Argentina, the host country, but towards the whole scientific community in Latin America. Since C. elegans is largely used to unravel mechanisms conserved throughout the animal kingdom, the interest for the meeting extends to scientist working on other models. 
In particular, we strongly believe that undergraduates and graduate students, young and consolidated investigators from our region will greatly benefit from the direct interaction with American leader scientists in the C. elegans field. To maximize student participation, we plan to devote a significant proportion of the budget to cover student´s travel and accommodation expenses. 
The meeting is an excellent opportunity for American labs to get an integrated and updated view on C. elegans research , providing knowledge on cutting edge methodologies and technologies. It will encourage discussion and future collaborations among the participants, which could strengthen collaborations and training for Latin-American labs.'

    body: 'Last May, the beautiful city of Cuernavaca, Mexico, received the Latin American community of zebrafish students and researchers in the fifth edition of the Latin American Zebrafish Network (LAZEN) Course and Meeting, organized locally by Enrique Salas, Denhí Schnabel, Fernando López Casillas and Hilda Lomelí.  LAZEN was born in 2010, in an initially timid initiative by four LASDB-member researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, that quickly grew to become a thriving and adaptable forum for all regional zebrafish researchers, well beyond developmental biology. <br>
The activity started with a full-time 7-day hands-on course, where some international instructors introduced a selected group of students to the current essential experimental approaches in zebrafish research, including CRISPR-based genome editing, transgenesis, optogenetics, techniques for cell and tissue labeling, confocal microscopy and live imaging. Lectures were also interspersed among the practicals. Students came from all over Latin America, with representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Uruguay, in addition to a participant from Egypt. Strategically positioned social activities helped to immediately generate a highly collaborative and friendly environment among students and instructors, who spent together more than 12 hours a day.<br>
The meeting was short (2 days) but intensive, with the participation of all the instructors and several other invited speakers, in a perfect balance of regional and international researchers, as well as covering an ever-growing diversity. Funding for both events was provided by ICGEB, UNU-Biolac and UNAM. During the meeting, a new network Board was elected, and the place for the VI LAZEN Course and Meeting was designated, coincident with LAZEN’s 10th anniversary in 2020: Peru.<br>

The 21 students of of the Quintay 2018 Course just published a post at The Node (see link below). <br>
    Every other year developmental biologist word leaders meet in a small fishing cove in Chile called Quintay to teach and share their excitement about development to students coming from all over Latin America. The course is intended primarily for Latin American student but it is also open to no-Latin American applicants, as the interaction between the students will establish links and promote a culture of international collaboration that will further contribute to the field. <br>
The course was initiated in 1999 when Roberto Mayor was working in Chile and it has continued, with only some brief interruptions, to these days. In the 2018 version of the course Nipam Patel and John Ewer enchanting us with the evolutionary approach to development, while Ray Keller and Roberto Mayor wandered us with the sophisticated embryological experiments on amphibian. Kate Whitlock showed the beauty of zebrasfish embryos and Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado amazed us with the regenerative power of planarian. The course ended with Claudio Stern and Andrea Streit teaching chick development.  This year the course was supported by EMBO, SDB and The Company of Biologist and, as in previous versions, the best student from the Quintay course was selected to attend the Embryology course in Woods Hole, USA.'

    body: '"The IV RiBiD-Chile (Red de Investigadores en Biología del Desarrollo) meeting was held at the School of Medicine of Universidad deChile last 5th January. Around a hundred of researchers met and attended 15 talks, including plenary lectures by Prof Roberto Mayor (UCL, UK) and Guillermo Lanuza (Instituto Leloir, Argentina).<br>
This meeting had the goal to bring together the Chilean scientific community working in developmental biology, stem cell biology, regeneration and ageing. But more important, it was the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to show their scientific work and get feedback from experienced scientists. We believe that during these meetings, new collaborations and opportunities will arise for our scientific community.<br>
We hope for the future to continue growing as a community and to keep organizing exciting meeting every summer.'

During five days a scientifically vibrant and diverse meeting was the platform to openly exchange ideas, consolidate common goals and promote collaboration among representatives from around 100 different research groups, many of them based in Latin America. The meeting for sure has served to inspire the current and following generations of Latin American Developmental Biologists. 
As a measure of the success we can highlight: 1) 250 attendees from all over the world, 2) the participation of 34 outstanding invited speakers, including Sir John Gurdon, Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 2012, as well as the presentation of 42 short talks and 82 posters, 3) the convening of two parallel satellite courses with 30 students from Latin America and abroad in "current topics and emerging models in developmental biology" and in "genomics and transcriptomics in non-model species". The next LASDB meeting will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2019. Looking forward to meeting you there.'
