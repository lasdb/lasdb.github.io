  - title: 'Cells & Development'
    date: '22/12/20'
    subtitle: 'Cells & Development: the future of MoD'
    body: 'The journal “MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT” (MoD) was born almost half a century ago under the name of “CELL DIFFERENTIATION”. Moving forward, this journal will open its pages to the study of the CELL and its role in DEVELOPMENT, and to reflect this change it will be renamed “CELLS & DEVELOPMENT”.  Furthermore, QUANTITATIVE BIOLOGY papers will be an important addition to our journal.  To reflect these changes, we have added the following subtitle: CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AND THEIR QUANTITATIVE APPROCHES.<br>
In addition to the above changes in topic and title, the new journal will create new sections and new activities that will directly benefit the cell, developmental and quantitative biology community. To achieve all these changes a new Editor-in-Chief has been appointed: Roberto Mayor, University College London, UK; and we have named a new panel of Associate Editors: Carl-Philipp Heisenberg (Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Austria), Sally Horne-Badovinac (University of Chicago, Chicago, United States), Ana-Maria Lennon-Duménil (Institut Curie, Paris, France), Guillaume Salbreux (Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom) and Didier Stainier (Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim, Germany).  This group of outstanding cell and developmental biologists will help us to guide the new “CELLS & DEVELOPMENT” journal toward the future. <br>
CELLS & DEVELOPMENT will consider papers in any area of cell biology or developmental biology, in any model system like animals and plants, using a variety of approaches, such as cellular, biomechanical, molecular, quantitative, computational and theoretical biology.
Areas of particular interest include: 
•	Cell and tissue morphogenesis
•	Cell adhesion and migration
•	Cell shape and polarity
•	Biomechanics
•	Theoretical modelling of cell and developmental biology
•	Quantitative biology
•	Stem cell biology
•	Cell differentiation
•	Cell proliferation and cell death
•	Evo-Devo
•	Membrane traffic
•	Metabolic regulation
•	Organ and organoid development
•	Regeneration <br>
CELLS & DEVELOPMENT  is the official journal of The International Society of Developmental Biologists which supports the world-wide community of developmental biologists and we will create new tools to equally support the cell biology community. <br>
It is our hope that this new phase of this half-centennial journal will be become a forum for interdisciplinary research that combines biology, physics and mathematics to understand how a cell works and how a single cell, the egg, develops into an embryo.'

    date: '16/09/20'
    subtitle: ''
    body: 'We are very sad to learn that Jose Luis Gomez-Skarmeta passed away today. A terrific scientist and friend who will be missed and remembered. Our sincere condolences to his family and friends.<br>
We share here a letter by his colleagues in the Developmental Biology lab in Chile.<br><br>
Ha partido nuestro amigo y colega luego de una batalla corta contra un cáncer. José Luis era investigador del Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo en Sevilla, España. Su investigación más reciente se relacionaba con los mecanismos genómicos que regulan el desarrollo y que impactan en la evolución de los vertebrados.<br>
José Luis tenía raíces chilenas (sobrino del escritor Antonio Skarmeta) pero creció y estudió en España. Su doctorado lo realizó en el Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa de Madrid, en el laboratorio del genetista Juan Modolell. Allí hizo estudios pioneros en Drosófila, desentrañando los mecanismos que inician los procesos de neurogénesis del sistema sensorial. Descubrió los genes de la familia Iroquois y nombró a dos de ellos como araucan y caupolican, en honor a los guerreros de Arauco. Al terminar su doctorado, resolvió trasladarse a Chile, a nuestro Departamento de Biología, donde estuvo desde 1997 al 2000. Allí, junto a Roberto Mayor y Miguel Allende, refundaron el laboratorio de Biología del Desarrollo que quedó vacante con la partida de Luis Izquierdo. Durante su estadía en Chile, trabajó con el anfibio Xenopus laevis, estudiando los genes involucrados en neurogénesis en ese modelo. En ese periodo, se formaron en el grupo Verónica Palma y Alvaro Glavic, quienes hoy suceden a José Luis y a Roberto Mayor como integrantes del grupo. José Luis retornó a España, primero brevemente en Madrid para luego obtener su plaza en Sevilla. Formó numerosos estudiantes y postdocs, entre ellos varios chilenos, y publicó trabajos de altísimo impacto, trabajando en pez cebra y en otros modelos.<br>
Recordamos a José Luis como un carismático y brillante científico. Por sobre todo, era un excelente amigo y colaborador desinteresado, era una persona de gran transparencia, tanto en lo científico como en lo humano. Hizo muchas amistades en su paso por la Facultad, tanto entre académicos como con los funcionarios, todos quienes lo recuerdan con cariño. Se mantuvo siempre vinculado con nosotros y pudimos disfrutar de su compañía por última vez en enero del 2019, cuando organizó un simposio con nosotros sobre genómica. Tuvimos mucha suerte de poder tenerlo cerca y contarlo entre nuestros buenos amigos.<br>
Alvaro Glavic, Miguel Allende, Verónica Palma, friends and colleagues'

    Dear members of the LASDB. <br>
We just had a great meeting in Buenos Aires to cap the end of October, and it really was the confirmation of Spring. A great deal of cutting-edge and exciting science was discussed, showing how vibrant and alive the LASDB is, and we look forward with anticipation to the next meeting, in two years time. This time there was a record of participation, and most to those attending were students, who discussed their work at length in the poster sessions. Already, many people how attended as students in the first LASDB meetings are now researchers, demonstrating the positive effect that the LASDB meetings and associated courses have had over its sixteen years of existence. We hope to continue on all those trends in the future, bringing ever more first rate science and students and PIs together, expanding developmental biology in the region, in an ever growing virtuous circle. Kudos to this last meeting organizers, and to the bright future of developmental biology in the region. As president of the LASDB, I really hope to continue all these positive trends, and greatly appreciate the confidence deposited in me.<br>

    subtitle: 'Virtual EMBO Workshop. REGISTRATION DEADLINE 20 August 2020'
    body: 'This EMBO Workshop is intended to cover the most recent work on the different aspects of the biology of a group of axial progenitors, often referred to as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), that play a fundamental role in the development of vertebrate embryos. We will stimulate discussions on the normal development and regeneration potential of these cells by bringing together a diverse group of researchers studying the activity of NMPs in a variety of animal models with those developing robust protocols to induce NMPs from pluripotent cells of mouse and human origin, as well as methods to further direct them towards specific cell lineages. An additional important goal for this workshop is to include researchers working on biological processes or cell-types exhibiting features that might suggest involvement of NMP-like activities, despite the fact that this cell-type is not the primary focus of their research. We expect this EMBO Workshop to act as a catalyst for interactions among researchers working in a variety of experimental paradigms in order to expand our knowledge of NMPs and their potential for regenerative medicine approaches in humans.'

    subtitle: 'February 19-21, 2020. Rosario, Argentina'
    body: 'C. elegans researchers from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico that have confirmed attendance to this Symposium have enthusiastically received this initiative. The impact of this project it is not limited to a small group of scientists in Argentina, the host country, but towards the whole scientific community in Latin America. Since C. elegans is largely used to unravel mechanisms conserved throughout the animal kingdom, the interest for the meeting extends to scientist working on other models. 
In particular, we strongly believe that undergraduates and graduate students, young and consolidated investigators from our region will greatly benefit from the direct interaction with American leader scientists in the C. elegans field. To maximize student participation, we plan to devote a significant proportion of the budget to cover student´s travel and accommodation expenses. 
The meeting is an excellent opportunity for American labs to get an integrated and updated view on C. elegans research , providing knowledge on cutting edge methodologies and technologies. It will encourage discussion and future collaborations among the participants, which could strengthen collaborations and training for Latin-American labs.'

This is a fantastic place to be isolated in a relaxed environment that allowed participants to talk about science, creating a highly collaborative and friendly environment to exchange ideas. The aim of this conference was to bring developmental biologists from other parts of the world to encourage students interested in this topic to attend the congress. On the other hand, a large number of young researchers who have arrived in Mexico as newly hired researchers were invited with the idea that they had the opportunity to present their work and also to generate collaboration opportunities with foreign and national groups.  
This congress brought together 35 experts, 16 which were nationals and 19 internationals. The talks were divided into 8 keynote and 27 short talks. The speakers came from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Israel, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Portugal.

    subtitle: 'LAZEN 2018'
    body: 'Last May, the beautiful city of Cuernavaca, Mexico, received the Latin American community of zebrafish students and researchers in the fifth edition of the Latin American Zebrafish Network (LAZEN) Course and Meeting, organized locally by Enrique Salas, Denhí Schnabel, Fernando López Casillas and Hilda Lomelí.  LAZEN was born in 2010, in an initially timid initiative by four LASDB-member researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, that quickly grew to become a thriving and adaptable forum for all regional zebrafish researchers, well beyond developmental biology. <br>
The activity started with a full-time 7-day hands-on course, where some international instructors introduced a selected group of students to the current essential experimental approaches in zebrafish research, including CRISPR-based genome editing, transgenesis, optogenetics, techniques for cell and tissue labeling, confocal microscopy and live imaging. Lectures were also interspersed among the practicals. Students came from all over Latin America, with representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Uruguay, in addition to a participant from Egypt. Strategically positioned social activities helped to immediately generate a highly collaborative and friendly environment among students and instructors, who spent together more than 12 hours a day.<br>
The meeting was short (2 days) but intensive, with the participation of all the instructors and several other invited speakers, in a perfect balance of regional and international researchers, as well as covering an ever-growing diversity. Funding for both events was provided by ICGEB, UNU-Biolac and UNAM. During the meeting, a new network Board was elected, and the place for the VI LAZEN Course and Meeting was designated, coincident with LAZEN’s 10th anniversary in 2020: Peru.<br>

    Every other year developmental biologist word leaders meet in a small fishing cove in Chile called Quintay to teach and share their excitement about development to students coming from all over Latin America. The course is intended primarily for Latin American student but it is also open to no-Latin American applicants, as the interaction between the students will establish links and promote a culture of international collaboration that will further contribute to the field. <br>
The course was initiated in 1999 when Roberto Mayor was working in Chile and it has continued, with only some brief interruptions, to these days. In the 2018 version of the course Nipam Patel and John Ewer enchanting us with the evolutionary approach to development, while Ray Keller and Roberto Mayor wandered us with the sophisticated embryological experiments on amphibian. Kate Whitlock showed the beauty of zebrasfish embryos and Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado amazed us with the regenerative power of planarian. The course ended with Claudio Stern and Andrea Streit teaching chick development.  This year the course was supported by EMBO, SDB and The Company of Biologist and, as in previous versions, the best student from the Quintay course was selected to attend the Embryology course in Woods Hole, USA.'

    subtitle: '4th Meeting RiBiD, Santiago, Chile. 5th January 2018'
    body: '"The IV RiBiD-Chile (Red de Investigadores en Biología del Desarrollo) meeting was held at the School of Medicine of Universidad deChile last 5th January. Around a hundred of researchers met and attended 15 talks, including plenary lectures by Prof Roberto Mayor (UCL, UK) and Guillermo Lanuza (Instituto Leloir, Argentina).<br>
This meeting had the goal to bring together the Chilean scientific community working in developmental biology, stem cell biology, regeneration and ageing. But more important, it was the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to show their scientific work and get feedback from experienced scientists. We believe that during these meetings, new collaborations and opportunities will arise for our scientific community.<br>
We hope for the future to continue growing as a community and to keep organizing exciting meeting every summer.'

    date: '30/1/17'
    subtitle: 'Medellin, Colombia. October 9-13, 2017'
    body: 'The IX LASDB2017 meeting was held in Medellín (Colombia) last October 2017. This was the first time Colombia, a megabiodiverse country at the core of the Americas, hosted the meeting. During five days a scientifically vibrant and diverse meeting was the platform to openly exchange ideas, consolidate common goals and promote collaboration among representatives from around 100 different research groups, many of them based in Latin America. The meeting for sure has served to inspire the current and following generations of Latin American Developmental Biologists. 
As a measure of the success we can highlight: 1) 250 attendees from all over the world, 2) the participation of 34 outstanding invited speakers, including Sir John Gurdon, Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 2012, as well as the presentation of 42 short talks and 82 posters, 3) the convening of two parallel satellite courses with 30 students from Latin America and abroad in "current topics and emerging models in developmental biology" and in "genomics and transcriptomics in non-model species". The next LASDB meeting will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2019. Looking forward to meeting you there.'
