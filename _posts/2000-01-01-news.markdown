    body: 'NEWS FROM COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS / DEVELOPMENT: <br>
    In 2024 we will be looking to diversify our Workshop programme so that we are able to support a wider selection of research communities around the world. <br>
To help us to achieve this goal, we will be reserving one of our 2024 Workshops for an application from a Global South (GS) country to host an event overseas. Our aim is to provide easier access for The Company of Biologists Workshops, bringing together world class scientists from home and abroad, and giving opportunities to local early-career researchers to attend.<br>
For your application to qualify for this funding, you will need to be applying to host the Workshop in one of the GS countries listed here: <br>
<a href="http://www.fc-ssc.org/en/partnership_program/south_south_countries" target="_blank">http://www.fc-ssc.org/en/partnership_program/south_south_countries</a><br>
To be successful, we will be looking for applications that include the following: <br>
* At least one organiser who is based in host region to act as a local contact throughout<br>
* Recommendations for a local venue to host the Workshop <br>
* Recommendations for accommodation and food for all attendees <br>
* An explanation of how this Workshop will benefit scientific research in your region <br>
* The focus should be on cutting-edge scientific research in topic areas that are novel and not covered by traditional conferences <br>
* Proposals that concentrate on emerging or cross-disciplinary themes are particularly encouraged <br>
Organisers should be experts in their field, or have sufficient standing to attract world-class speakers and attendees. Each Workshop will consist of 35 delegates including 15 speakers and 20 early-career researchers (places to be applied for). Proposers should ensure maximum diversity in the proposed attendee list. <br>
As the scientific organiser, your involvement will be focused on the science. We will undertake most of the logistical arrangements, liaise with the venue, organise speaker travel and assist with the programme construction. We hope to work closely with our local contact to help put on the best possible Workshop for all of our attendees, so we would welcome any local knowledge and support to make the event a success. We may also require some assistance in finding local suppliers and technical support for the event in some cases. <br>
The Workshop will be entirely funded by The Company of Biologists, including all accommodation, venue and travel costs throughout the event. We will also provide travel bursaries for qualifying early-career researchers to help them get to the Workshop.<br>

In addition to the above changes in topic and title, the new journal will create new sections and new activities that will directly benefit the cell, developmental and quantitative biology community. To achieve all these changes a new Editor-in-Chief has been appointed: Roberto Mayor, University College London, UK; and we have named a new panel of Associate Editors: Carl-Philipp Heisenberg (Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Austria), Sally Horne-Badovinac (University of Chicago, Chicago, United States), Ana-Maria Lennon-Duménil (Institut Curie, Paris, France), Guillaume Salbreux (Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom) and Didier Stainier (Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim, Germany).  This group of outstanding cell and developmental biologists will help us to guide the new “CELLS & DEVELOPMENT” journal toward the future. <br>
CELLS & DEVELOPMENT will consider papers in any area of cell biology or developmental biology, in any model system like animals and plants, using a variety of approaches, such as cellular, biomechanical, molecular, quantitative, computational and theoretical biology.
Areas of particular interest include: 
•	Cell and tissue morphogenesis
•	Cell adhesion and migration
•	Cell shape and polarity
•	Biomechanics
•	Theoretical modelling of cell and developmental biology
•	Quantitative biology
•	Stem cell biology
•	Cell differentiation
•	Cell proliferation and cell death
•	Evo-Devo
•	Membrane traffic
•	Metabolic regulation
•	Organ and organoid development
•	Regeneration <br>
CELLS & DEVELOPMENT  is the official journal of The International Society of Developmental Biologists which supports the world-wide community of developmental biologists and we will create new tools to equally support the cell biology community. <br>
It is our hope that this new phase of this half-centennial journal will be become a forum for interdisciplinary research that combines biology, physics and mathematics to understand how a cell works and how a single cell, the egg, develops into an embryo.'

    subtitle: ''
    body: 'We are very sad to learn that Jose Luis Gomez-Skarmeta passed away today. A terrific scientist and friend who will be missed and remembered. Our sincere condolences to his family and friends.<br>
We share here a letter by his colleagues in the Developmental Biology lab in Chile.<br><br>
Ha partido nuestro amigo y colega luego de una batalla corta contra un cáncer. José Luis era investigador del Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo en Sevilla, España. Su investigación más reciente se relacionaba con los mecanismos genómicos que regulan el desarrollo y que impactan en la evolución de los vertebrados.<br>
José Luis tenía raíces chilenas (sobrino del escritor Antonio Skarmeta) pero creció y estudió en España. Su doctorado lo realizó en el Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa de Madrid, en el laboratorio del genetista Juan Modolell. Allí hizo estudios pioneros en Drosófila, desentrañando los mecanismos que inician los procesos de neurogénesis del sistema sensorial. Descubrió los genes de la familia Iroquois y nombró a dos de ellos como araucan y caupolican, en honor a los guerreros de Arauco. Al terminar su doctorado, resolvió trasladarse a Chile, a nuestro Departamento de Biología, donde estuvo desde 1997 al 2000. Allí, junto a Roberto Mayor y Miguel Allende, refundaron el laboratorio de Biología del Desarrollo que quedó vacante con la partida de Luis Izquierdo. Durante su estadía en Chile, trabajó con el anfibio Xenopus laevis, estudiando los genes involucrados en neurogénesis en ese modelo. En ese periodo, se formaron en el grupo Verónica Palma y Alvaro Glavic, quienes hoy suceden a José Luis y a Roberto Mayor como integrantes del grupo. José Luis retornó a España, primero brevemente en Madrid para luego obtener su plaza en Sevilla. Formó numerosos estudiantes y postdocs, entre ellos varios chilenos, y publicó trabajos de altísimo impacto, trabajando en pez cebra y en otros modelos.<br>
Recordamos a José Luis como un carismático y brillante científico. Por sobre todo, era un excelente amigo y colaborador desinteresado, era una persona de gran transparencia, tanto en lo científico como en lo humano. Hizo muchas amistades en su paso por la Facultad, tanto entre académicos como con los funcionarios, todos quienes lo recuerdan con cariño. Se mantuvo siempre vinculado con nosotros y pudimos disfrutar de su compañía por última vez en enero del 2019, cuando organizó un simposio con nosotros sobre genómica. Tuvimos mucha suerte de poder tenerlo cerca y contarlo entre nuestros buenos amigos.<br>
Alvaro Glavic, Miguel Allende, Verónica Palma, friends and colleagues'

    Dear members of the LASDB. <br>
We just had a great meeting in Buenos Aires to cap the end of October, and it really was the confirmation of Spring. A great deal of cutting-edge and exciting science was discussed, showing how vibrant and alive the LASDB is, and we look forward with anticipation to the next meeting, in two years time. This time there was a record of participation, and most to those attending were students, who discussed their work at length in the poster sessions. Already, many people how attended as students in the first LASDB meetings are now researchers, demonstrating the positive effect that the LASDB meetings and associated courses have had over its sixteen years of existence. We hope to continue on all those trends in the future, bringing ever more first rate science and students and PIs together, expanding developmental biology in the region, in an ever growing virtuous circle. Kudos to this last meeting organizers, and to the bright future of developmental biology in the region. As president of the LASDB, I really hope to continue all these positive trends, and greatly appreciate the confidence deposited in me.<br>

    body: 'This EMBO Workshop is intended to cover the most recent work on the different aspects of the biology of a group of axial progenitors, often referred to as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), that play a fundamental role in the development of vertebrate embryos. We will stimulate discussions on the normal development and regeneration potential of these cells by bringing together a diverse group of researchers studying the activity of NMPs in a variety of animal models with those developing robust protocols to induce NMPs from pluripotent cells of mouse and human origin, as well as methods to further direct them towards specific cell lineages. An additional important goal for this workshop is to include researchers working on biological processes or cell-types exhibiting features that might suggest involvement of NMP-like activities, despite the fact that this cell-type is not the primary focus of their research. We expect this EMBO Workshop to act as a catalyst for interactions among researchers working in a variety of experimental paradigms in order to expand our knowledge of NMPs and their potential for regenerative medicine approaches in humans.'

    body: 'C. elegans researchers from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico that have confirmed attendance to this Symposium have enthusiastically received this initiative. The impact of this project it is not limited to a small group of scientists in Argentina, the host country, but towards the whole scientific community in Latin America. Since C. elegans is largely used to unravel mechanisms conserved throughout the animal kingdom, the interest for the meeting extends to scientist working on other models. 
In particular, we strongly believe that undergraduates and graduate students, young and consolidated investigators from our region will greatly benefit from the direct interaction with American leader scientists in the C. elegans field. To maximize student participation, we plan to devote a significant proportion of the budget to cover student´s travel and accommodation expenses. 
The meeting is an excellent opportunity for American labs to get an integrated and updated view on C. elegans research , providing knowledge on cutting edge methodologies and technologies. It will encourage discussion and future collaborations among the participants, which could strengthen collaborations and training for Latin-American labs.'

The workshop aims to establish mechanistic links between cell/tissue mechanics and cell fate specification during development, providing a forum for scientific interactions, the cross-fertilization of ideas, the fostering of new collaborations and the development of strategies to address emerging technical needs and close existing gaps in knowledge. The scientific content will thematically progress from cellular mechanics, to mechanics of tissue morphogenesis, to the integration of mechanics with cell fate, and ending with addressing how cell fate and self-organization can be coupled in an emergent tissue. Selected abstracts will be chosen for short talks and presented during poster sessions. '

    body: 'Last October, the Mexican Society of Development Biology (SMBD) organized its XIII National Congress and also its first International Congress in Ex-hacienda of Chautla in Puebla, Mexico. This is a fantastic place to be isolated in a relaxed environment that allowed participants to talk about science, creating a highly collaborative and friendly environment to exchange ideas. The aim of this conference was to bring developmental biologists from other parts of the world to encourage students interested in this topic to attend the congress. On the other hand, a large number of young researchers who have arrived in Mexico as newly hired researchers were invited with the idea that they had the opportunity to present their work and also to generate collaboration opportunities with foreign and national groups.  
This congress brought together 35 experts, 16 which were nationals and 19 internationals. The talks were divided into 8 keynote and 27 short talks. The speakers came from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Israel, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Portugal. The International Society of Development Biologists supported to SMBD with the ISDB-MOD Lecture to bring Ginés Morata of the Center of Molecular Biology CSIC of the Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain. <br>

    date: '7/8/18'
    subtitle: 'LAZEN 2018'
    body: 'Last May, the beautiful city of Cuernavaca, Mexico, received the Latin American community of zebrafish students and researchers in the fifth edition of the Latin American Zebrafish Network (LAZEN) Course and Meeting, organized locally by Enrique Salas, Denhí Schnabel, Fernando López Casillas and Hilda Lomelí.  LAZEN was born in 2010, in an initially timid initiative by four LASDB-member researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, that quickly grew to become a thriving and adaptable forum for all regional zebrafish researchers, well beyond developmental biology. <br>
The activity started with a full-time 7-day hands-on course, where some international instructors introduced a selected group of students to the current essential experimental approaches in zebrafish research, including CRISPR-based genome editing, transgenesis, optogenetics, techniques for cell and tissue labeling, confocal microscopy and live imaging. Lectures were also interspersed among the practicals. Students came from all over Latin America, with representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Uruguay, in addition to a participant from Egypt. Strategically positioned social activities helped to immediately generate a highly collaborative and friendly environment among students and instructors, who spent together more than 12 hours a day.<br>
The meeting was short (2 days) but intensive, with the participation of all the instructors and several other invited speakers, in a perfect balance of regional and international researchers, as well as covering an ever-growing diversity. Funding for both events was provided by ICGEB, UNU-Biolac and UNAM. During the meeting, a new network Board was elected, and the place for the VI LAZEN Course and Meeting was designated, coincident with LAZEN’s 10th anniversary in 2020: Peru.<br>

The 21 students of of the Quintay 2018 Course just published a post at The Node (see link below). <br>
    Every other year developmental biologist word leaders meet in a small fishing cove in Chile called Quintay to teach and share their excitement about development to students coming from all over Latin America. The course is intended primarily for Latin American student but it is also open to no-Latin American applicants, as the interaction between the students will establish links and promote a culture of international collaboration that will further contribute to the field. <br>
The course was initiated in 1999 when Roberto Mayor was working in Chile and it has continued, with only some brief interruptions, to these days. In the 2018 version of the course Nipam Patel and John Ewer enchanting us with the evolutionary approach to development, while Ray Keller and Roberto Mayor wandered us with the sophisticated embryological experiments on amphibian. Kate Whitlock showed the beauty of zebrasfish embryos and Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado amazed us with the regenerative power of planarian. The course ended with Claudio Stern and Andrea Streit teaching chick development.  This year the course was supported by EMBO, SDB and The Company of Biologist and, as in previous versions, the best student from the Quintay course was selected to attend the Embryology course in Woods Hole, USA.'
