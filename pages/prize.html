    <div class="panel-body">
        <p> We are happy to announce the reestablishment the LASDB Prize that is to be awarded to outstanding developmental biologists, which might have shown (desirable but not essential) an involvement or active interest in Latin American science. The Prize has been awarded only once by our Society to Roberto Mayor in 2013 and it is now our intention to reestablish the prize and select an awardee on a regular basis every two years.
Any of you can nominate a candidate. Nominations should be sent directly to the LASDB president (Email address: pwappner@leloir.org.ar) by the closing deadline on November 15.   Nominations should consist of a short statement of support (maximum 1 page A4) from the proposer, stating why the candidate is suitable for the prize. Self-nomination is not allowed. Neither the proposer, nor the candidate need to be LASDB members. The Committee will select the awardee by December 15.
 
The LASDB Prize Selection Committee is formed by Eric Wieschaus, Marianne Bronner, Angela Nieto, Alfonso Martinez Arias, Eddy de Robertis, Ruth Lehmann, Maria Leptin, Claudio Stern, Alejandro Sanchez Alvarado, Guillermo Oliver, Roberto Mayor and Pablo Wappner. 
 
Thanking in advance and looking forward for nominations.
