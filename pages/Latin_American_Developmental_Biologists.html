"Mapping Latin American Developmental Biologists - in Latin America and Abroad" <br>
   A Directory of Developmental and Stem Cell Biology Researchers and Laboratories.</p><br>
       
<p style="; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 1.03em;">
The database is designed to serve as a resource for investigators, postdocs, students, and technicians working in developmental biology and stem cell research.<br>
We hope this initiative will become a valuable tool to foster regional and international collaborations, increase visibility of Latin American labs, and support networking across the developmental biology community. <br>
The searchable database interface will be publicly available in the coming months.<br><br>

The form is simple and takes less than 5 minutes to complete.<br><br>
(*) No LASDB membership required — The form is open to any researcher based in Latin America working in developmental biology or related fields.<br>
(*) Also open to Latin American researchers abroad — We welcome entries from Latin American scientists working internationally who maintain strong ties to the region.<br><br>
