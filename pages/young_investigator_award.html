        <p> In recognition of his outstanding research in developmental biology in Latin America during the early stages of his independent career, the Selection Committee arrived to the unanimous decision of awarding Pablo Strobl-Mazzulla (Argentina) with the LASDB New Investigator Prize 2024.<br>
The award was made at the LASDB-2024 Congress in Valparaíso, where Pablo gave a plenary lecture.<br>
<b>Congratulations Pablo !!!</b><br><br>   </p>               
   
        <p> Pablo Strobl-Mazzulla has made important contributions to the field of developmental biology and he has an active involvement in science education both locally and internationally. After a postdoc at Caltech, Pablo established his independent laboratory in Argentina in 2011, becoming group leader of the Developmental Biology lab in INTECH, Chascomus (Province of Buenos Aires). Works from his lab have contributed to a deeper understanding of the role of the epigenetic mechanisms that control cell specification and differentiation during development in vertebrates. <br><br>
